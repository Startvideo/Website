        <h2>Jessica & Brian's Testimonial</h2>
        <p><strong>WE WOULD ABSOLUTELY RECOMMEND SERGE TO ANYONE!!!</strong></p>
        <p>Serge did an absolutely amazing job! He is extremely talented, creative, professional and easy to get along
           with (even during all the wedding chaos and stress, when we weren't always our most calm!). The end product
           was truly incredible. It really blew us away - he captured our most special moments perfectly, and was able
           to convey the spirit and "feeling" of our day...</p>

        <p>He took the time to talk with us several times, to meet with us in person in advance, and to arrive early to scope out the setting. He really put in a lot of time and effort, and we truly feel like he went above and beyond what a normal videographer would do.</p>

        <p>He is also able to capture those special moments in the perfect way. We had been concerned that having video during the ceremony would be distracting or would take away from the moment. Honestly, it did not! Serge integrated seamlessly and during that most important moment, we didn't even feel like he was there! Yet, the video of that moment is crystal clear and perfect!</p>

        <p>We simply cannot rave about Serge enough. He is a true artist and professional. You will not find anyone who will be as excited to hear about your details or who will put in as much thought into how to capture YOUR special day.</p>

        <h2>M & S's Testimonial</h2>
        <p>Serge's video of our wedding day was truly a work of art! Both the highlight clip and full movie versions fully captured the essence of our day.</p>

        <p>Serge has an amazing talent for being able to blend different parts of the video while creatively incorporating music to punctuate every unspoken thought and emotion. Watching the video has enabled us and our families to relive all the wonderful and joyous moments of that day.</p>

        <p>One of the best parts of working with Serge was that I never once felt that he was intrusive. He was able to film the wedding without interfering, yet captured every candid, funny and heartwarming moment. Serge is highly professional, and creates quality films that last a lifetime!</p>

        <p>I highly recommend his services. The end result is nothing short of perfection. The quality of his work and services are truly unparalleled and we are forever grateful to him for perfectly capturing the best day of our lives!!</p>
